Comparing Regression models to see which one fits the best.


**PROCEDURE**


1. saw how many features are there, shape of the data.


2. made correlation matrix, pair-plots, histograms


3. saw the outliers using boxplots and discarded them using Inter Quartile Range.


4. Used Multiple Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest in predicting in the test set.


**RESULTS**

Best R^2 value(it asseses the goodness of fit of the statistical model) is given by Multiple Linear Regression


0.9140869002437227


MSEâ€™s basic value is in selecting one prediction model over another. the least value was given by
